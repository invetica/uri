#+STARTUP: showall

*URI* makes working with URIs a little more convenient, without duplicating the
existing functionality provided by Java.

* Warning! Data readers included
This library includes a reader literal that will affect the way Clojure writes
instances of ~java.net.URI~. If your do not want a URI to end up looking like
the example below, do not add this to your codebase.

#+begin_src clojure
  {:user/name "Charlie Collie"
   :user/website #invetica/uri "https://myspace.com/charlie.223"}
#+end_src

* Usage
See the example in ~dev/invetica/uri/example.clj~.

The following specs are included:

#+begin_src clojure :exports none
  (->> (clojure.spec.alpha/registry)
       keys
       (filter keyword?)
       (filter #(= "invetica.uri" (namespace %)))
       sort)
#+end_src
